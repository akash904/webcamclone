Webcam Clone is a free, open-source software that allows you to make a clone video of yourself and replace your live feed with it during a live meeting. It supports Zoom, G-Meet, MS-Teams, etc.

## Key Features
- Switch between live feed and virtual feed with a single click
- Record a clone video during the call itself with a single click
- Seamless fast transitions making it impossible to detect

## Why Open Source?
The creators of Webcam Clone believes that if this technology is easily available and everyone knows how to make it, it will become more common. This will make it impossible for people who want to misuse this technology and will make development in this field easier, faster, and more transparent.
